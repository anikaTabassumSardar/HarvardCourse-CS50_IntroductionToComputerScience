# Problem Set 1
* Programming Language: C
* Coding environnment: https://ide.cs50.io/

## Project overview:
This project demonstrates basic understanding and implementation of programming concepts with the programming language C.

## Project(s) include:
### Hello
- Takes user input using cs50 library for strings and print greet user with their name.
- Project file: [hello.c](hello.c)
- Run the following commands:
  - make hello.c
  - ./hello
  
### Mario (beginner)
- Takes user input for height and builds a pyramid like the mario game.
- Project file: [marioBeginner.c](marioBeginner.c)
- Run the following commands:
  - make marioBeginner.c
  - ./marioBeginner
 - Pseudocode: [pseudocode_MarioBeginner.md](https://github.com/anikaTabassumSardar/CS50_HarvardCourse/blob/master/Week%201%20-%20C/Snapshots%20%26%20Text%20Files/pseudocode_MarioBeginner.md)
 - Snapshot of the pyramid: [MarioBeginnerPyramid](https://github.com/anikaTabassumSardar/CS50_HarvardCourse/blob/master/Week%201%20-%20C/Snapshots%20%26%20Text%20Files/MarioBeginnerPyramid.JPG)
 
### Mario (intermediate)

### Cash (beginner)
-  A program that first asks the user how much change is owed and then prints the minimum number of coins with which that change can be made. The only coins available are quarters (25¢), dimes (10¢), nickels (5¢), and pennies (1¢). The instruction asks for a greedy algorithm.
- Project file: [cashBeginner.c](cashBeginner.c)
- Run the following commands:
  - make cashBeginner
  - ./cashBeginner
  
### Credit (intermediate)

## To run the app:
* For this problem set, you’ll use CS50 IDE, a cloud-based programming environment. This environment is similar to CS50 Sandbox and CS50 Lab, the programming environments that David discussed during lecture.
